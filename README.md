# Credit Scoring Model using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end Credit Scoring System using machine learning to predict whether a customer is creditworthy based on financial and behavioral attributes. The system is designed to simulate a real-world banking and financial risk assessment workflow.

The model uses structured customer financial data and applies feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation to build a reliable credit risk prediction system.

This project was developed as part of the CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship.

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions need to assess the credit risk of customers before approving loans. Manual credit evaluation is time-consuming and may be inconsistent. This project automates the process by using machine learning to classify customers as:

- Creditworthy (Low Risk)
- Not Creditworthy (High Risk)

The goal is to improve decision-making accuracy and reduce financial risk.
